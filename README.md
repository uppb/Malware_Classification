# Convolutional Malware Classifier with Attention


This is a machine learning model for classifying malicious software into one of nine families

## Requirements

* Python 3.6.8
* TensorFlow 2.6.0
* Numpy 1.19.5
* Pathlib 1.0.1
* Pandas 1.1.5
* Matplotlib 3.3.4

**OR**

Use the provided `requirements.txt`\
Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Change the "path" variable in `settings.py`.\
If the dataset downloaded is not within the project path, change the "dataset_path" too.
  * In the original files, everything is under the project path. The dataset and the code are in different folders under the project path.

2. Run `python mini_dataset_labels.py` if you wish to run on a smaller dataset (100 files).\
This will create a `truncatedTrainLabels.csv` file.

3. Run `python file_preprocessing.py` to group files by the 9 malware family.\
This will create a `train` folder with 9 folders.

4. Run `python data_preprocessing.py` to group create and save training, validation, and testing dataset.\
This will create 3 folders `train_save`,`val_save`, and `test_save`.

5. Run `python train_model.py` to train the train_model
